# NFL-Code---Medium
Predicting NFL scores


This repository includes two Jupyter notebook scripts, the csv (NFL data) and plots from the scripts. Please use the script “Final_NFL_Code_Medium.ipynb”. The original script included an error in the time series portion. The 2 game average and 5 game average included the current observation score.The Final code fixes the error.
